# Lexy UX Vision v1 — "Delightfully Obvious"

## Product Feeling
The app should feel:
- **Obvious** (users instantly know what to do)
- **Responsive** (clear feedback on every action)
- **Trustworthy** (real data, clear state, no broken visuals)
- **Guiding, not noisy** (assistive details appear when needed)

## UX Principles
1. **One primary job per screen state**
2. **Progressive disclosure over stacked complexity**
3. **Visible system status at all times**
4. **No dead ends** (every failure state has recovery action)
5. **Visual confidence cues** (consistent spacing, hierarchy, and action placement)

## Information Architecture (target)
- **Search tab**: query -> results -> card detail -> add to collection
- **Coach tab**: prompt -> guidance -> decision card
- **Collection tab**: manage cards -> refine filters -> quantity actions

## Visual System Direction
- Card-first layout with consistent thumbnail containers
- Status banner region fixed near top (loading/error/success)
- Strong section headers + compact helper text
- Mobile-first spacing and touch-safe controls

## Delight Bar (Definition of Done)
A feature is done only if:
- It works for real user intent
- It communicates state clearly
- It recovers gracefully from failure
- It feels simple on first use
