# Team Standup — 2026-02-26

## Directive from Frank
Build products that work as intended and feel delightful. Do not hide behind defaults/error handling as a substitute for real functionality.

## Team Alignment
- **Tron:** enforce outcome-first delivery and block "checkbox-complete" behavior.
- **Pam:** acceptance criteria must include delight metrics (clarity, speed, confidence), not only technical pass.
- **Archy:** require architecture paths that improve real reliability, not only failure tolerance.
- **Lexy:** define UX north star for each sprint before implementation starts.
- **Gino:** implement functional outcomes first, then resilience hardening.
- **Andy:** validate lived experience, not only happy-path click-through.
- **Moss:** fail builds that pass tests but violate intended user behavior.
- **Roy:** reject code that masks defects with placeholder behavior unless explicitly temporary and ticketed.
- **Doc:** make intent and quality bars obvious in README/docs.

## Non-Negotiable Working Rule
Error handling is required, but never counted as feature completion.

## New Quality Prompt (for all gates)
"Would a real user feel this works, trust it, and want to keep using it?"

## Immediate Actions
1. Promote UX vision brief to sprint input artifact.
2. Update README for readability and visual structure.
3. Add graphics plan for README and in-app visual direction.
4. Start Sprint 2 with UX-first acceptance criteria.
