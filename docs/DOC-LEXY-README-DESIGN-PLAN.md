# Doc + Lexy Joint Plan — README Readability + Visual Upgrade

## Goals
1. Make README fast to scan (30-60 seconds for orientation).
2. Improve visual structure with diagrams/graphics.
3. Align README tone with product promise: functional and delightful.

## Proposed README Structure
1. Hero (what it is + quick links)
2. Product screenshots/gifs
3. "Try in 3 minutes" quickstart
4. Feature tour (Search / Coach / Collection)
5. Architecture diagram
6. Reliability + quality gates
7. Roadmap and contribution flow

## Graphics to add
- `public/graphics/ux-flow.svg` (user flow map)
- `public/graphics/system-architecture.svg` (API/component map)
- `public/graphics/quality-gates.svg` (team gate order)
- Optional: short GIF of key user journey

## Copy style updates
- Short paragraphs
- Strong section labels
- Fewer walls of text
- Tables only where they improve scanning

## Definition of Better README
- New contributor can run app in <5 minutes
- User can understand core value in <30 seconds
- Team process and quality bar are visible without deep reading
