# J9 — Deterministic trace identity

## Preconditions
- Same input payload reused across repeated calls

## Trigger
- Call `buildDecisionCard(input)` twice with identical input.

## Expected (binary)
- `decision_trace_id` format is 16-char lowercase hex (`^[a-f0-9]{16}$`)
- Trace ID from call 1 equals trace ID from call 2

## Negative checks
- Trace ID must not change when payload is unchanged

## Timeout budget
- <= 75ms for two local calls.
